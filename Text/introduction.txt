This document is the "Design and VHDL handbook for VLSI development". It was originally developed by CNES for its internal projects in order to improve the way VHDL code is written and thus reducing the time spent to perform code review. This development was made keeping in mind that this kind of handbook might be useful for other companies that would have wanted to share common VHDL rules between them and their subcontractors. That is the reason why this handbook is divided into two chapters:
-	The first one is called the "Standard Rules" which includes general rules or recommendations that are common between all companies working with VHDL. These rules share a general agreement between CNES and partners initially involved. Addition and changes to these rules have to be agreed by everyone.
-	The second one is called "Custom Rules" which includes company specific rules that are adapted/refined from standard rules or completely new. These custom rules allow third party companies to create their own version of the VHDL Handbook.

A handbook is a collection of Rules written in XML following a specific schematic described inside a document called "VHDL handbook XML schema definition" (reference DCT-TV-IN-2014-9100). This XML file (or these XML files as there might be one standard and/or several customs ones) is the master source for this PDF file which is created automatically with an XSLT processor and FOP. 
The XML source file can be opened by any modern spreadsheet editor providing an easy and straightforward way to create applicability or verification matrix.

Inside the XML handbook file, rules are identified with a unique ID number which is formatted as follows: LLL_DDDDD with L representing a Letter and D a Digit. Some three letters match is reserved like STD for standard rules and CNE for CNES specific rules (see DCT-TV-IN-2014-9100 for more reserved trigrams).

A rule is part of a category/subcategory group and includes information like: a name, a short and long description, a rationale, good and bad VHDL examples, revision and even figures if needed.

A rule is always associated with severity: 
-	Major is selected when the rule is mandatory. Any deviation to a Major rule must be reported in a Non-Conformance Report and must be agreed by customer. 
-	Minor is selected when the rule might lead to critical consequences. Non-conformance to a Minor rule can be approved in dedicated meeting, without Non-Conformance Report. 
-	Note is selected when the rule is for information only. The handbook user is responsible for the application (or not) of this rule. It is usually best practices but not for every kind of situation.

Some rules might be sons of a parent rule. This was done to group unitary rules dealing with the same point. This notion was introduced to help company to easily tailor rule for compliance matrix has it is only mandatory to be compliant with the parent rule and not with each of its sons (nevertheless being compliant with the sons or equivalent custom sons rules is a good starting point to achieve compliance with the parent rule).


Every one wishing to create a custom handbook can freely do so. This project was made with this strong concern in mind. You simply have to create a custom XML Ruleset following the schema described in the document DCT-TV-IN-2014-9100. Nevertheless to work flawlessly with standard rules or others customs handbooks, the creator of a new ruleset should better ask CNES for a reserved trigram letter identifying its company custom Rules.

Authors of this handbook wish to thank every (direct or indirect) contributor to this revision including:
-	People who agreed to share some of their internal knowledge to the benefit of everyone,
-	People who participated to the review of this document,
-	People who did the edition of this document,
-	People from W3C, Apache Software Foundation, Eclipse Foundation and creator of the Veditor plugin.

Thank you all for being a precious part of this activity and making it exist.
